# Quick-Sort-Using-Java-and-Python

## Abstract
This study aims to observe and evaluate the best string sorting algorithm based on the provided dataset. String sorting algorithms come in a variety of forms, and each sorting method serves a different purpose. Therefore, it is vital to select the appropriate string sorting technique for the provided dataset. As a result, we have decided to analyse three string sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. At the results of the case, the findings revealed that quick sort was the most efficient method for sorting the entire dataset. In addition, rapid sort made good use of the pivot number selection. With the software running, the string's performance may be assessed.

## Result
Python programming language produces 51 LOC (line of code), a file extension capacity of 98 Kbytes, and an execution time of approximately 19 milliseconds. While Java produces a number of LOC as much as 120, a capacity of .java file extension of 4 Kbytes, and an execution time of 28 milliseconds. Meanwhile python is 38% faster than java to run quick sort algorithm of the same dataset. So, python programming language is more optimal and efficient compared to Java to sort a list of string data.
